;; Exercise 1.25
;;
;; Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing "expmod". After all, she says, 
;; since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written
;;
;; (define (expmod base exp m)
;;   (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
;;
;; Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.
